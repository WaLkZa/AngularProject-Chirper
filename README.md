# AngularProject-Chirper

Web application (SPA) using Angular with cloud-based backend (Kinvey). The app keeps users and chirps (tweets). Users can register, login, logout, view feed page (all chirps from followers sorted by time in descending order), create a chirp, delete a chirp, view own chirps, discover new people, get all chirps by specific user (sorted by time in descending order), follow or unfollow a user. Admins have access to edit and delete chirps to all users. Also they can delete users.
